            <p className="text-white text-lg">Hello everyone! I’m a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Victoria, passionate about expanding my skills across various areas of tech. While I’ve been focusing on web development—working with React, JavaScript, and modern UI libraries—I also enjoy improving my knowledge in backend systems, database design, and security practices. I love diving into new technologies and frameworks across different fields, always striving to reach a solid level of competency.</p>
